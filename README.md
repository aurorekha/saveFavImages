## Read me about the project, about the things i may not have understood correctly.

* Creating a like unlike app for images.

## How did i start my project

* At first read the document and identified the tasks.
* Created and estimated tickets.
* Picked and worked on tickets one after another. Used Kanban for this.(of course!)

## Tech Spec

* React
* SCSS, BEM
* JS
* Webpack
* Yarn
* Express

## Design

* This design is inspired by the wall in my living room. I really like the fact that
it looks like pictures are hanging on the wall.

## Hurdles

* A task which seemed a arduous but doable ended being a little stubborn in it's ways.
  1 - The api kept deciding to stop working had to change the tags every now and then to keep it working
  2 - Using localStorage with plain JS is simpler than using with React as I didn't know it wouldn't properly work without refs.
  4 - Getting the api was a little painful as I had to add nojsoncallback=1 which took some looking around. And even now the api is constantly flickring!
  5 - Barely worked with localStorage before so that was simple but still obviously was fun to play around with.

## Tech Spec Justification

* I chose react because you asked for SPA. and adding SCSS, CSS loaders was a little task as didn't have to use those before because of styled components.
* BEM makes accessibility better and it just is nicer in general. Always my go to preference for naming convention.
* Express because we all use express and it is really a powerful server library.

## Final thoughts

* I had a good time working on this task. It was fun and got to play around with some of the things that i personally didn't have to do from scratch previously but got to do it on this occasion. There are some bugs which i am still working on fixing but apart from that i had fun working on this and would make this into a bigger app as I have some more ideas about it.
