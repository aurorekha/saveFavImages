## Read me about the project, about the things i may not have understood correctly.

* Creating a like unlike app for images.

## Tech Spec

* React
* SCSS, BEM
* JS
* Webpack
* Yarn
* Express

## Design

* This design is inspired by the wall in my living room. I really like the fact that
it looks like pictures are hanging on the wall.


## Tech Spec Justification

* I chose react for SPA. and adding SCSS, CSS loaders was a little task as didn't have to use those before because of styled components.
* BEM makes accessibility better and it just is nicer in general. Always my go to preference for naming convention.
* Express because we all use express and it is really a powerful server library.
